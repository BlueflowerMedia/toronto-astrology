      <h1>Negative Energy Removal</h1>
      <p class="subservice-text">It's critical to clear negative energy if you buy anything used and want to bring it to your home or office, especially if you don't know the history of that item. . Classic example are jewelry pieces that can bring very bad luck to the new owner. Maybe the tragic events of the original owner's life were so great that even family members did not want to keep it. Negative energy needs something to “cling to.” Arrange your room with as much wide-open space as possible, allowing any negative energy to disperse. Even just moving the furniture to clean behind can break up the flow of energy. Turn that chair to face a different way, move that pot, or hang a different piece of art work.</p>
