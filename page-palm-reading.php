      <h1>Palm Reading</h1>
      <p class="subservice-text">You will take digital pictures of both hands of the person or persons you want a reading for (see samples below) and e-mail them to us along with their date of birth, whether the subjects are right or left hander, and, their profession and/or desires. It is also helpful to me if you include a picture of yourself, but not required. If you have specific questions, include them in the e-mail, however, Tony will only respond to the question if he receives an answer while doing the reading. Astrologer Krishna is not a “fortune teller” but will pass on any feelings he gets during the reading. His readings are more about an individual’s traits, talents, and karma and how best to use those talents to create their own best futures.</p>
